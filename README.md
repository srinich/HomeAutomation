# HomeAutomation

A JavaScript application simulating house automation: pressing a button on a control panel would visually turn on a light, change the temperature or close the curtains.

The application is built using JQuery functions. The application simulates "server interaction" (using a static file for simplicity, can be easily extended to use a persistent storage). In this demo, the heating component retrieves the current temperature from the a local storage and also saves the desired one back to the local storage. 

To run this application, simply download the project as zip from link : https://github.com/srinich/HomeAutomation/archive/master.zip. Now, extract the files to a local folder and open the index.html page in a browser. A working demo of this application will be available in this URL for sometime : http://srinic.com
